Rentr app

This full stack application will allow prospective renters to post information that is critical to the apartment application process so as to streamline the rental process.


Technologies used: 
 - Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
 - These programming languages will be used for the functionality and design / layout of the application.
 - The use of encryption is very important in this application due to the various pieces of private information that will be stored.
                  

Approach taken: 
- Following the Ruby on Rails model of setting up a web application, I will create tables that allow information to be stored for the apartment and applicant. The use of a join table will be important in connecting the two interacting parties. 
- There will be a post-it board style way of listing prospective renters that will be created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Installation instructions:
- The user will create a username and password that allows them access to creation of a profile page where they will store the following pieces of information: Phone number, e-mail address, date of birth, ID, employment history, income statement, income verification, current address, time at current address, property owner information, credit report, and neighborhood sought out.
- Landlords will be able to make profiles that allow them to request information from potential applicants for the apartment/property they are advertising

Unsolved problems:
- how to allow users to post to certain neighborhoods.


User stories: 
- Applicant user will post their information requested in the profile creation setup page. They will include the prospective neighborhood.
- Apartment user (landlord) will search through the list of profiles that have posted in the neighborhood of the apartment and request encrypted information that the applicant user has posted. 
- If the applicant user agrees to the request and would like to apply to the apartment, they can grant permission to the apartment user (landlord) so as to officially apply to the listing.
